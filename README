We are interested in developing an LLM-Based Recipe Generator Web App, which is designed to help users explore new recipes tailored to their taste preferences, health goals, and other personalized attributes. Whether users are unsure of what to cook with just a few ingredients, or are seeking inspiration for delicious weight-loss recipes, the app provides users with personalized recipes with room to alter or modify these outputs to their liking. The objective of this project is to simplify the recipe-finding process by providing an AI driven solution. The app is intended for homecooks, those with busy schedules, food enthusiasts, and simply anyone who is in need of some culinary inspiration and doesnâ€™t have the time to parse through the countless recipes out there. The motivation behind this project comes from the everyday struggle of deciding what to cook. This struggle is a common one and the lazy solution to this is often to cook the same old mundane recipes. Or, one may spend hours searching for the perfect recipe to satisfy their preferences. Why sacrifice time and sanity when there is a clear solution to this problem. This Recipe Generator Web App aims to solve this problem by generating tailored recipes to users within just seconds, revolutionizing the way people approach cooking and meal planning by making it more intuitive and engaging.
